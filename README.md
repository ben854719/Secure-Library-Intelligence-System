# Secure-Library-Intelligence-System

# Project Overview:

This Node.js application provides secure, credential-based access to a digital library system while leveraging agentic AI to monitor and respond to potential cybersecurity threats. User profiles are encrypted to ensure privacy and integrity, and authenticated access enables users to explore and borrow electronic books or register for media content. An integrated AI component continuously scans for suspicious activity, alerting cybersecurity analysts in real time and generating comprehensive incident reports during unauthorized access attempts or irregular document transfers.

# Key Features:

 # User Authentication & Encryption:
 
- Strong encryption (e.g. AES-256) applied to user profiles and credentials.
- Authorization through username and password prior to library access.
- Optional support for multi-factor authentication.

# Agentic AI Threat Detection:

- AI continuously monitors the system for unauthorized access attempts.
- Detects anomalies during digital media downloads or profile interactions.
- Automatically generates detailed incident reports for security teams.
- Alerts triggered for suspicious behavior or system breaches.

# Installation:

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building and executing server-side code.
- LangGraph: Agentic AI framework used for orchestrating threat detection logic. 
- Gemini: Large language model for natural language processing and generating incident reports.
