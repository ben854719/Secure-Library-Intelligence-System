            "    *   **Description:** This log entry indicates that the network monitoring systems have detected unusual or potentially malicious traffic. This could be anything from unauthorized scanning, attempts to exfiltrate data, or command-and-control communication from malware. It's a general alert that requires deeper investigation into network flow logs and intrusion detection system (IDS/IPS) alerts.\n",

            "\n",
            "2.  **Anomaly: Unauthorized File Access**\n",
            "    *   **Description:** This is a serious security breach. An unauthorized user or process has gained access to a file, which could lead to data theft, data corruption, or the execution of malicious code. This requires immediate investigation to identify the file, the unauthorized entity, and the extent of the access.\n",
            "    *   **Related Log Entry:** \"File accessed by unauthorized user\"\n",

            "3.  **Anomaly: Suspicious Transfer of Electronic Documents between Library Systems**\n",
            "    *   **Description:** This is a direct and critical anomaly related to your specific concern. It indicates unusual or unauthorized activity concerning the transfer of electronic documents between library systems. This could signify:\n",
            "        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive documents being copied or moved out of the library systems without authorization.\n",
            "        *   **Tampering:** Documents being altered during transfer.\n",
            "        *   **Compromised Accounts/Systems:** An attacker might be using legitimate library system credentials or a compromised system to initiate these transfers.\n",
            "        *   **Policy Violation:** Transfers occurring outside of established protocols or approved channels.\n",

            "    *   **Description:** A failed login attempt from an unknown IP address (192.222.3.103) suggests an unauthorized individual or automated script (e.g., a brute-force attack or credential stuffing) is attempting to gain access to a system. While a single failed attempt isn't always critical, repeated attempts or attempts from multiple unknown IPs would indicate a persistent attack.\n",

            "Immediate actions should include:\n",
            "*   Investigating the source and nature of the suspicious document transfer.\n",
            "*   Analyzing network traffic and system logs for the \"Suspicious activity detected in network traffic\" alert.\n",
            "*   Identifying the \"unauthorized user\" and the \"file accessed\" to assess the impact of the breach.\n",
            "*   Blocking the IP address 192.222.3.103 and investigating any other login attempts from it.\n",
            "*   Reviewing security configurations and access controls across all library systems.\n"
